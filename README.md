# Focus AI 
**Personalized AI-Generated Micro-Lessons for Accelerated Learning** 

### ¨Project Overview
Focus AI is a prototype designed to bridge the gap between dense academic curricula and student retention. Using an **AI-driven Assessment Loop**, the platform identifies exactly where a student's knowledge gaps lie and provides the specific resources needed to bridge them. 

### Problem
Many students struggle to keep up with dense academic content and long curricula.  
Traditional study methods often fail to:
* Identify specific knowledge gaps
* Adapt to each student’s pace
* Keep learners motivated over time

### Solution
Focus AI uses an AI-driven assessment loop to:
* Diagnose what a student does and doesn’t understand
* Generate short, targeted micro-lessons
* Recommend videos and resources only when needed
* Track progress from “needs study” to “mastered”
* 

### How It Works
1. **Diagnostic Quiz**  
   The student answers a short, targeted quiz on a specific topic.
2. **Gap Detection**  
   Focus AI analyzes the responses to find exactly which concepts are not yet mastered.
3. **Micro-Lesson Generation**  
   The system generates short, focused explanations and examples tailored to the student’s needs.
4. **Optional Video Support**  
   When helpful, Focus AI suggests relevant videos for visual learners.
5. **Progress Tracking**  
   Each attempt is logged so students can see their journey from confusion to mastery over time.

### Target Users
* **High school students** preparing for exams and needing help identifying weak spots.
* **University students** dealing with dense lectures and complex readings.
* **Self-learners** exploring new subjects without formal classes.
* **Busy learners** who only have short time blocks and need efficient, focused study sessions.

### Design Principles
* **Micro over macro:** Keep lessons short and focused so students can learn in small, achievable steps.
* **Personalization first:** Adapt content to each learner instead of forcing everyone through the same path.
* **Clarity over complexity:** Explanations prioritize plain language and concrete examples.
* **Feedback-driven:** Use quiz results and progress data to continuously improve recommendations.

### Tech Stack
**AI & Logic**
* Large Language Model (LLM) for generating personalized micro-lessons
* AI-driven assessment loop to detect knowledge gaps in real time
  
**Data & Tracking**
* Progress logging system to track learning status from “needs study” to “mastered”

**Developer Tools**
* GitHub for version control and project hosting
  
### Core features
* **Intelligent Diagnostic Quiz:** The AI evaluates your current mastery level to decide-in real-time-if you require further study or are ready to move on. 
* **Automated Lesson Generation:** If a gap is identified, the system generates custom micro-lessons and records them for review. 
* **Smart Video Sourcing:** Dynamically generates YouTube content if a visual explanation is needed for a specific topic. 
* **Progress Logging:** Full tracking of the learning journey, allowing students to see their evolution from "needs study" to "mastered".

### Future Improvements (Roadmap)
**Adaptive Difficulty**
- Continuously adjusts lesson difficulty based on performance and response time.
- Builds personalized learning paths instead of one-size-fits-all content.

**Study Streaks & Motivation**
- Daily streak tracking and progress milestones.
- Gentle reminders to encourage consistent learning habits.

**Mobile-Friendly Experience**
- Fully responsive design for phones and tablets.
- Quick micro-lessons optimized for short study sessions on the go.

**Teacher / Mentor Dashboard**
- Tools for educators to assign lessons, review progress, and identify student gaps.
- Insights and analytics to support targeted instruction.

**Smarter Recommendations**
- Suggests next topics automatically based on past results.
- Learns from user behavior to make guidance more accurate over time.

**Offline Notes & Review**
- Ability to save personal notes inside lessons.
- Built-in review mode for concepts previously marked as “needs study.”



### Installation / Try It
You can try Focus AI directly in your browser — no installation required:
**Live prototype:** https://focus-ai-992a44d4.base44.app
If the page doesn’t load right away, refresh and wait a few seconds, the prototype may need time to initialize.

### Disclaimer
Focus AI is an early-stage prototype created for learning and experimentation.  
It is not a finalized product, and features may change as the project evolves.

###  Pilot Results & Impact

FocusAI was piloted informally with more than **50 students** at my school. Students shared that the tool helped them:

* quickly identify specific weak concepts  
* avoid wasting time re-studying material they already understood  
* feel less overwhelmed before exams  

Teachers who saw the prototype appreciated that the explanations stayed short and targeted, instead of replacing notes with even more text.

###  What I Learned While Building FocusAI

* how to design learning flows that adapt to different students  
* how to structure AI prompts so explanations stay clear and step-by-step  
* how to debug logic when mastery tracking didn’t behave as expected
*  how to iterate based on real user feedback instead of assumptions

 ###  Current Limitations

FocusAI is an early prototype. Some limitations include:

* Not every topic gets a YouTube video 
* recommendations are based on limited pilot data  

These are areas I plan to improve as the project grows.

*If you’re an educator, student, or developer and would like to test or improve FocusAI, I’d love feedback.  
I’m especially interested in ideas around spaced repetition, accessibility, and ethical AI in education.*
