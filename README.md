# Focus AI 
** Personalized AI-Generated Micro-Lessons for Accelerated Learning** 

### ¨Project Overvieuw

### Core features

* **Intelligent Diagnostic Quizz:** The AI evaluates your current mastery level to decide-in real-time-if you require further study or are ready to move on. 
* **Automated Lesson Generation:** If a gap is identified, the system generates custom micro-lessons and records them for review. 
* **Smart Video Sourcing:** Dynamically generates Youtube content if a visual explanation is needed for a specific topic. 
* **Progress Logging:** Full tracking of the learning journey, allowing students to see their evolution from "needs study" to "mastered".
