# Focus AI 
**Personalized AI-Generated Micro-Lessons for Accelerated Learning** 

### ¨Project Overview
Focus AI is a prototype designed to bridge the gap between dense academic curricula and student retention. Using an **AI-driven Assessment Loop**, the platform identifies exactly where a student's knowledge gaps lie and provides the specific resources needed to bridge them.

### Tech Stack
**AI & Logic**
* Large Language Model (LLM) for generating personalized micro-lessons
* AI-driven assessment loop to detect knowledge gaps in real time
  
**Data & Tracking**
* Progress logging system to track learning status from “needs study” to “mastered”

**Developer Tools**
* GitHub for version control and project hosting
  
### Core features
* **Intelligent Diagnostic Quiz:** The AI evaluates your current mastery level to decide-in real-time-if you require further study or are ready to move on. 
* **Automated Lesson Generation:** If a gap is identified, the system generates custom micro-lessons and records them for review. 
* **Smart Video Sourcing:** Dynamically generates YouTube content if a visual explanation is needed for a specific topic. 
* **Progress Logging:** Full tracking of the learning journey, allowing students to see their evolution from "needs study" to "mastered".

### Future Improvements (Roadmap)
**Adaptive Difficulty**
- Continuously adjusts lesson difficulty based on performance and response time.
- Builds personalized learning paths instead of one-size-fits-all content.

**Study Streaks & Motivation**
- Daily streak tracking and progress milestones.
- Gentle reminders to encourage consistent learning habits.

**Mobile-Friendly Experience**
- Fully responsive design for phones and tablets.
- Quick micro-lessons optimized for short study sessions on the go.

**Teacher / Mentor Dashboard**
- Tools for educators to assign lessons, review progress, and identify student gaps.
- Insights and analytics to support targeted instruction.

**Smarter Recommendations**
- Suggests next topics automatically based on past results.
- Learns from user behavior to make guidance more accurate over time.

**Offline Notes & Review**
- Ability to save personal notes inside lessons.
- Built-in review mode for concepts previously marked as “needs study.”
