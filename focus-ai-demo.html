Before building the full AI-based prototype, I created a very simple HTML/JavaScript demo to test the core idea behind FocusAI:  
**if a student makes a mistake, immediately show a short, targeted explanation.**

You can find it here
In this version, the user answers a basic math question (“What is 2 + 2?”).  
- If the answer is correct, the system confirms understanding.  
- If the answer is wrong, a short **micro-lesson** appears, explaining the idea in very simple terms.

This helped me validate the micro-lesson concept before integrating AI and more complex logic.
